            Hey yo! Thinks are getting stagnant for sure. After this two week I've done lots of job application with will hopefully get me something in the next months. I'm also 
            studying for the CNU, which is a national exam for public jobs here, and it is too much to keep track of. Doing my best to study and remember it all, but not too 
            confident about it. Nowadays it is really hard to study things outside of logical and science stuff, most laws read to me as common sense. However, the more I read the 
            better I can understand why this stuff is written in the way it is. First insight is to really limit where this law are supposed to effect and what not. Word are carefully
            tailored to have a clear meaning inside a specific scope. This is necessary otherwise people find way to distort interpretation of what is written. Second point is I'm not
            convinced the first reason is entirely responsible for the way things are written. It is tough, it has lot of unusual words for day-to-day vocabulary and I think it is made 
            this way to keep it from people to learn and understand it. Keep in mind I'm uneducated in this field and this might be a opinion based in nothing, but I can't help but 
            feel this way.  
          </p>
          <p>
            I have noticed theses cards are awful to read on. Last time I checked font and spacing were awful and hurt my eyes to read them. I'll have this improved as soon as I 
            feel like dealing with this. Also, I'm planning to move this website from GitHub to self hosting. I've learned a lot from it and now I think I can do it, I might have 
            to configure my Pi and leave it on. This remember me that I have an inclination to web structure. Now that my career seems to be failing apart, it might be a good idea to 
            to invest in it. Restart sound awful, but moving forward seems like a lost cause.
          </p>
          <p>
            Yesterday I was reading one of the most revealing boom I read recently, Pedagogia do Oprimido from Paulo Freire. If you haven't read yet, please do. Anyways, there is
            this part where Freire talks about Tiradentes which is a famous character of brazilian history. He uses this character in order to justify doing the correct and believing
            on truth, rightfulness, and speak up for other, that even though you might suffer, truth will prevail. I love this idea, I've lived to it since I can remember. Even though,
            I have failed sometimes mostly due to financial problems or fear of losing my current job/future opportunity, I try to live like he said. Because I believe in it, for real.
            Every time I kneel down to those that have tried to oppresses me, I felt like real rubbish and lost my will in doing whatever I was doing. On other hand, when I have spoke up,
            my life became free. However, I've been feeling alone lately. It feel like no one like to be near someone that is not willing to kneel down in face of oppression, because it
            will cause them suffer. No one is willing to suffer for other, it seem. Funny thing is, I do. Not that I don't have my limits, everyone does. But I have make my life difficult
            speaking against injustice and would do it every time. Otherwise sleep would be difficult and life would have no meaning.
          </p>
          <p>
            That is enough rent, I will keep fighting. I might not be able to achieve anything, but I'll stay true to myself.

            Yo, salve. It is been a long time. More than I whished too. I as hoping that I could bring to you more news soon, but turned out I've been searching for a new
            position since. I've done two interviews which made clear that companies around me are skeptical of hiring me due to my background in academia. There is this huge 
            disconnection between academia and industry. Often time when I'm talking to them, despite explaining it, even the vocabulary stands out between us. They love to use 
            acronyms to concepts that shouldn't need it and I on other hand use a vocabulary that is often too simple, when being afraid of makes things hard to understand, or 
            too complex to see the importance of what I'm trying to explain. My wife has been helping me in this part and it is being really helpful. With each interview I feel 
            more confident to the next.
          </p>
          <p>
            After this two refusals (and my scholarship finishing next February) I've being open to basically every opportunity that life throws at me. Looking for private 
            universities, jobs, post doc and anything that could provide me a living. Even though we are not desperate, another house income is what provide us our comfort,
            hobbies, and what else could make a proud husband than being able to provide stupid expensive thing for his family ?
          </p>
          <p>
            Rough days for sure. I've being doubting myself since I couldn't find anything since March, but I've come a long way. Also, I'm reevaluating what I should be doing,
            and after reading a lot of Paulo Freire and Darcy Ribeiro I found my love and passion for my country and education. Research will be missing me in the future, I hope.
          </p>
          <p>
            Speaking of research, I surely miss learning and working together with people. Most time I feel that I'm working alone, and my decision are always wrong. Not motivated
            at all to continue in this direction when what is important to me seems not important to academia, with no change in sight.
          </p>
          <p>
            About work, I've been working in a new paper that is very promising. Even though I still feel all my analysis and learning are easily tossed away without the same care 
            I used to build it, this one has been a great opportunity to three people from different mindsets makes a multidisciplinary analysis in one of my research subjects. I've
            being working with things that I'm definitely not comfortable, way harder than my small brain can process, but from what I understand has come out beautifully. And I'm 
            very excited to finally being able to publish it.
          </p>
          <p>
            Wish me luck!

          </h3>
          <p>
            Those are the last 2-3 weeks for me in this city. I have enjoyed a lot the Italian/Neapoletean 
            culture. I have learned a lot about myself and the culture that have had great impact on the 
            Brazilian culture.
          </p>
          <p>
            I learned to enjoy a culture and their people by the way they present themselves. I had days
            that I want to cry of frustration, but had days of overjoy in this place. A city full of culture
            and their phrases for everything you can imagine! 
          </p>
          <p>
            That being said, I miss a lot of my stuff already. Glad to be back as soon as possible.

          <p>
            Today I've experienced my first earthquake ever! It was about midnight when the ground
            start shaking. I was confused because everything was dark, but I could sense that 
            something was moving inside the room which I though could be someone. Weird. It took
            the same time for the earthquake to pass for me realize what was happening.
          </p>

          <p>
            Napoli is a city that lives besides three volcanoes, being the Vesuvius the most known.
            People often think when we talk about volcanoes, we were talking about Vesuvius. However,
            the most active one is located in Pozzuoli. 
          </p>

          <p>
            In the end, a nice shaking. No alarm. No shouting. Everyone went fast asleep soon after
            and I couldn't hear anything.
          </p>

          <p>
            Better without earthquakes, though.

          <p>
            I've taken the time to learn some HTML and CSS, and readability should be
            far better now. I have no intention of learning this professionally, this 
            begun when I tried to make a simple portfolio to store my CV. I couldn't
            find any template that fulfill what I had in mind. Most templates were also
            really difficult to edit, which didn't help. I am like this, if is not simple
            and I can't understand I will make it as dumb as possible.

            Hi everyone, this is the first post on this blog. I am very happy to share some thoughts with you.
            I've created this site to fullfil many purposes, but mainly to host my works. 
          </p>
        
          <p>
            I've put some much effort in trying to use open tools -- some times making my life more difficult
            -- with the expectation that I could share this, have a discussing and make life of people easier.
            I know this isn't the best way to do that, however it was what I'm able to do right now. 
          </p>

          <p>
            On other hand, I have enjoyed this process of messing with HTML and CSS. I am nowhere close
            to be proficient, but it is working for now. Let us see how this will unwrap.
