          </h3>
          <p>
            Yo, salve. It is been a long time. More than I whished too. I as hoping that I could bring to you more news soon, but turned out I've been searching for a new
            position since. I've done two interviews which made clear that companies around me are skeptical of hiring me due to my background in academia. There is this huge 
            disconnection between academia and industry. Often time when I'm talking to them, despite explaining it, even the vocabulary stands out between us. They love to use 
            acronyms to concepts that shouldn't need it and I on other hand use a vocabulary that is often too simple, when being afraid of makes things hard to understand, or 
            too complex to see the importance of what I'm trying to explain. My wife has been helping me in this part and it is being really helpful. With each interview I feel 
            more confident to the next.
          </p>
          <p>
            After this two refusals (and my scholarship finishing next February) I've being open to basically every opportunity that life throws at me. Looking for private 
            universities, jobs, post doc and anything that could provide me a living. Even though we are not desperate, another house income is what provide us our comfort,
            hobbies, and what else could make a proud husband than being able to provide stupid expensive thing for his family ?
          </p>
          <p>
            Rough days for sure. I've being doubting myself since I couldn't find anything since March, but I've come a long way. Also, I'm reevaluating what I should be doing,
            and after reading a lot of Paulo Freire and Darcy Ribeiro I found my love and passion for my country and education. Research will be missing me in the future, I hope.
          </p>
          <p>
            Speaking of research, I surely miss learning and working together with people. Most time I feel that I'm working alone, and my decision are always wrong. Not motivated
            at all to continue in this direction when what is important to me seems not important to academia, with no change in sight.
          </p>
          <p>
            About work, I've been working in a new paper that is very promising. Even though I still feel all my analysis and learning are easily tossed away without the same care 
            I used to build it, this one has been a great opportunity to three people from different mindsets makes a multidisciplinary analysis in one of my research subjects. I've
            being working with things that I'm definitely not comfortable, way harder than my small brain can process, but from what I understand has come out beautifully. And I'm 
            very excited to finally being able to publish it.
          </p>
          <p>
            Wish me luck!

            A good day for me. Finally got to publish a paper I have been working for too long with a friend of mine. It was very hard work and a lot of trial and adjustments.
          </p>

            I am now back to Brazil. I have changed some perspectives about life and I am trying new hobbies. It is tough to be alone all day at home, wish I could get a
            position soon. I don't completely hate the academia job, it just I wish I could work with more people to achieve things,

            Napoli is ending for me!
          </h3>
          <p>
            Those are the last 2-3 weeks for me in this city. I have enjoyed a lot the Italian/Neapoletean 
            culture. I have learned a lot about myself and the culture that have had great impact on the 
            Brazilian culture.
          </p>
          <p>
            I learned to enjoy a culture and their people by the way they present themselves. I had days
            that I want to cry of frustration, but had days of overjoy in this place. A city full of culture
            and their phrases for everything you can imagine! 
          </p>
          <p>
            That being said, I miss a lot of my stuff already. Glad to be back as soon as possible.

            Dangerous experience
          </h3>
          <p>
            Today I've experienced my first earthquake ever! It was about midnight when the ground
            start shaking. I was confused because everything was dark, but I could sense that 
            something was moving inside the room which I though could be someone. Weird. It took
            the same time for the earthquake to pass for me realize what was happening.
          </p>

          <p>
            Napoli is a city that lives besides three volcanoes, being the Vesuvius the most known.
            People often think when we talk about volcanoes, we were talking about Vesuvius. However,
            the most active one is located in Pozzuoli. 
          </p>

          <p>
            In the end, a nice shaking. No alarm. No shouting. Everyone went fast asleep soon after
            and I couldn't hear anything.
          </p>

          <p>
            Better without earthquakes, though.

            I've been frustrated with my job right now and it gives me a lot of time
            to work on this website, which is nice! 
          </p>

          <p>
            I've taken the time to learn some HTML and CSS, and readability should be
            far better now. I have no intention of learning this professionally, this 
            begun when I tried to make a simple portfolio to store my CV. I couldn't
            find any template that fulfill what I had in mind. Most templates were also
            really difficult to edit, which didn't help. I am like this, if is not simple
            and I can't understand I will make it as dumb as possible.
          </p>

          <p>
            This lead to this update. Far better version :).

            Hi everyone, this is the first post on this blog. I am very happy to share some thoughts with you.
            I've created this site to fullfil many purposes, but mainly to host my works. 
          </p>
        
          <p>
            I've put some much effort in trying to use open tools -- some times making my life more difficult
            -- with the expectation that I could share this, have a discussing and make life of people easier.
            I know this isn't the best way to do that, however it was what I'm able to do right now. 
          </p>

          <p>
            On other hand, I have enjoyed this process of messing with HTML and CSS. I am nowhere close
            to be proficient, but it is working for now. Let us see how this will unwrap.
