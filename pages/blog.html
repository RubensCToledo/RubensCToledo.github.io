            Dangerous experience
          </h3>
          <p>
            Today I've experienced my first earthquake ever! It was about midnight when the ground
            start shaking. I was confused because everything was dark, but I could sense that 
            something was moving inside the room which I though could be someone. Weird. It took
            the same time for the earthquake to pass for me realize what was happening.
          </p>

          <p>
            Napoli is a city that lives besides three volcanoes, being the Vesuvius the most known.
            People often think when we talk about volcanoes, we were talking about Vesuvius. However,
            the most active one is located in Pozzuoli. 
          </p>

          <p>
            In the end, a nice shaking. No alarm. No shouting. Everyone went fast asleep soon after
            and I couldn't hear anything.
          </p>

          <p>
            Better without earthquakes, though.

            I've been frustaded with my job right now and it gives me a lot of time
            to work on this website, which is nice!

          <p>
            I've taken the time to learn some HTML and CSS, and readability should be
            far better now. I have no intention of learning this professionaly, this 
            begun when I tried to make a simple portifolio to store my CV. I couldn't
            find any template that fullfill what I had in mind. Most templates were also
            really difficult to edit, which didn't help. I am like this, if is not simple
            and I can't understand I will make it as dumb as possible.
          </p>

          <p>
            This lead to this update. Far better version :).

            Hi everyone, this is the first post on this blog. I am very happy to share some thoughts with you.
            I've created this site to fullfil many purposes, but mainly to host my works. 
          </p>
        
          <p>
            I've put some much effort in trying to use open tools -- some times making my life more difficult
            -- with the expectation that I could share this, have a discussin and make life of people easier.
            I know this isn't the best way to do that, however it was what I'm able to do right now. 
          </p>

          <p>
            On other hand, I have enjoyed this process of messing with HTML and CSS. I am nowhere close
            to be proeficient, but it is working for now. Let us see how this will unwrap.
