      <h2>
        Bibliometric Analysis
      </h2>
      <p>
        The bibliometric analysis is a meta-analysis, that by definition,
         tries to find conclusion from analysing data. In my case I was trying to 
         see the metrics of the field of research of my PhD. There are other software 
         available like VOSviewer that have a ready solution for this type of analysis, 
         but I wish to conduct some analysis that weren't implemented and decided to develop
        a code with my wife and a friend, you can check:
        </p>
        <h4><a href="/backup/Bib_git(1).ipynb">Download here</a></h4> 
        <p>
          (I'm aware that part of the code is breaking due to changes in libraries,
          I might revisit it on future but for now I have no plans to update it) 
          or the papers that used this code (or the variation one my wife used)
          <a href="https://www.mdpi.com/1996-1073/16/9/3623">here</a> and 
          <a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/14644207241240048">here</a>.  
      </p>
      <p>
        I wish to say that this code was meant to be a work in progress, 
        which was thought to be an open software to use.
         However people around me by the time didn't shared the same enthusiasm on the
          results and for this reason I stopped after the first version,
           which didn't come close to a V1.0.
      </p>
      <p>
        I believe this analysis is very useful for a beginning of any research as it 
        gives you a broad overview of your research field. In this analysis is possible
         to identify the relevant people and works, highlights the promising journal 
         used by your peers for your future paper and visualize the topic size and growth.
      </p>
      
      <h3>
        Pre data treatment
      </h3>
      <p>
        In this situation I wished to review a certain topic and I wanted to get all or 
        most of the work that was relevant to my research. 
        I've put together two of the largest database on academia: Scopus and Web of Science.
         The problem with those Databases are the difficulty of filtering the relavant 
         paper from the batch. Both Databases work with keyword combination that might
          match with specific areas of a paper. However people are not consistent where
           to put the information, which if you restrict you search you lose information
            or if you are too broad, you get a lot of information that is not matched
             with the search. 
      </p>
      <p>
        The pipeline of data treatment follows:
        <ol>
          <li>Comparison of both database and remove equals;</li>
          <li>Manual scan of the remaining batch to ensure relevancy;</li>
          <li>Extract of key information relevant to the analysis
            (Material information, experimental setup and condition, 
            key finds, year, country, names, citation number received, citation made and journal);
          </li>
          <li>Treatment of language differences, spelling, missing information and such;</li>
          <li>Results.</li>
        </ol>        
      </p>

      <h3>
        Analysis
      </h3>
      <h4>
        Publications and Citations by Country
      </h4>
      <p>
        The analysis that I wished to make are number of publication per country and their citation:
      </p>
      <img src="/images/bibliometric/country_cita.png" alt="publication/country">
      <p>
        For this analysis every paper attributed a single unit of publication for every country 
        in the author's name. The same thing was made with the cumulative citation number,
        if two author of the same country were present in a paper, only a single unit of 
        paper number and citation number was used.
      </p>
      <p>
        The main difficulty here was to extract the information of country name due to the
         inconsistency of some journal, missing information and differences between databases.
          Also, different spelling of countries and abbreviations had do be dealt with.
      </p>
      <p>
        This analysis was thought to help identify which countries produce more paper 
        (which somewhat translate to how much investment in the field they have) 
        and how relevant are the paper produced (number of citation).
      </p>
      <h4>
        Cumulative Documents and Citations by Year
      </h4>
      <p>
        Next analysis was cumulative number of documents and citation per year:
      </p>
      <img src="/images/bibliometric/doc-cita_year.png" alt="cumaltive documents year">
      <p>
        Challenges here are about the same of the other analysis and went way smoother. 
        This analysis sought to identify which year have the most relevant work to help 
        to understand the context of the field and also to identify technology defining 
        discovery (if you have few paper in a year and lots of citation, higher chance 
        of having a pretty important paper there).
      </p>
      <p>
        To highlight the importance of the manual filtering, here is a comparison of
        same analysis with and without the manual analysis for relevance. 
        You can see how misleading the analysis become without it:
      </p>
      <img src="/images/bibliometric/doc-cita_year.png" alt="doc year citation">
      <img src="/images/bibliometric/doc-cita_year_comparison.png" alt="doc year citation comparison">
      <h4>
        Author Analysis
      </h4>
      <p>The next analysis was meant to be a extrapolation of the previous analysis:</p>
      <img src="holder" alt="Author year citation">
      <p>
        This analysis consisted of attributing citation of every paper to each author and 
        ranking them. After that the first five first author with the higher number of 
        citation were ranked and the the previous analysis was conducted for each one of 
        them as observed on the above figure. The idea was to identify their most relevant work. 
        The code also feature the same analysis not taking account the first author and 
        for the last author as well.
      </p>
      <h4>
        Journal Analysis
      </h4>
      <p>This analysis was different analysis of the author, only this time instead of the author
         I looked to the journal.
      </p>
      <img src="/images/bibliometric/journal-cita.png" alt="journal citation">
      <p>My goal was to identify what journal have the highest ration of citation/publication. 
        This result should be used as reference to where to send you paper. 
        As a researcher you would like to have a good exposition of your work and chosing 
        the right journal might help people to get to know your work. Even thoguh there a lot 
        more to it, this is indeed an value guide that you could use to weight your decision.
      </p>

      <h4>
        keyword analysis
      </h4>
      <p>
        Which leads us to the next analysis which is which keyword used inside of the 
        paper that have the higher number of citation.
      </p>
      <img src="/images/bibliometric/kw.png" alt="keyword citation">
      <p>
        Instead of journal or author, the citation of each paper were attributed to every 
        keyword inside the paper. Those keyword for all the database were them ranked and 
        the result is the image above. Still on the topic of visibility, I have found that 
        the best way to identify a work in those databases is using keyword or in title, 
        abstract or keyword field. even though this analysis is limited to the keyword field, 
        it also server as a thermometer to see which keyword your peers are using which you 
        might want use if you want more visibility.
      </p>
      <p>
        English is the main language of academia, but the majority of the researcher are 
        not native to the English language. This might leads to different word being used. 
        Also, a common thing that I have noticed is the use of acronym which you might have 
        to pay attention.
      </p>

      <h4>
        co-citation web
      </h4>
      The last (and coolest) analysis is the co-citation web, where you can verify the 
      relation of which author is working with author.
      <img src="/images/bibliometric/bang(1).jpeg" alt="web">
      <p>
        The final and most visually striking analysis is the co-citation web, 
        which maps relationships between authors. Unfortunately, 
        I can’t explain this in detail, as my wife developed this analysis independently.
      </p>
    <h2> How to use the code!</h3>
    <p>
      I will try to have a guide like discussion of how to use this code,
      if you ever need it. This code expect you to have access to SCOPUS and 
      web of science platform, however you can edit this for any database that
      have a similar format.
    </p>
    <p>
      After you exported the .csv file with the relevant information for This
      analysis (which usually is the affiliation, citation, names and etc). You
      can fire up the code!.
    </p>
    <p>First things first, make sure you have all the libraries installed.
    </p>
    <pre><code class="language-python">
      import pandas as pd
      import numpy as np
      import re
      pd.set_option("display.max_rows", None , "display.max_columns", None)
      from collections import Counter
      import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
      from matplotlib import cm
      from matplotlib.image import NonUniformImage
    </code></pre>
    <p>
      Those are the libraries I have used in my last analysis, you maybe do not
      need everything that is in there.
    </p>
    <p>
      Okay, first line will be responsible to import your .csv file. Just make
      sure you don't change the name of the DataFrame (dfs), because it is used
      for the whole code.
    </p>
    <pre><code class="language-python">
      dfs = pd.read_csv('scopus_manual.csv')
    </code></pre>
    <p>
      Next piece of important code comes right bellow, and this section makes
      sure I filter all information I don't want. Your .csv file is going to have
      different information depending of what you select on SCOPUS.
    </p>
    <pre><code class="language-python">
      dfs.drop(columns = ['Author(s) ID','Volume','Issue', 'Art. No.',
                         'Page start', 'Page end', 'Page count', 'Link',
                        'Authors with affiliations','Molecular Sequence Numbers',
                        'Chemicals/CAS', 'Tradenames', 'Manufacturers', 'Editors',
                        'Funding Details', 'Funding Text 1', 'Funding Text 2', 
                        'Funding Text 3', 'Sponsors', 'Publisher', 'Conference name',
                        'Conference date', 'Conference location', 'Conference code',
                        'Correspondence Address', 'ISSN', 'CODEN','ISBN', 'PubMed ID', 
                        'Language of Original Document', 'Publication Stage',
                        'Document Type','EID', 'Abbreviated Source Title'],
                        inplace = True)

    </code></pre>
    <p>The next section extract the country information from the affiliation
      information. If you ever need to take other information from the affiliation
      section (like cities). Here is where you have to edit:
    </p>
    <pre><code class="language-python">
      for c in range(len(dfs['Affiliations'].values)):  
        a = dfs['Affiliations'].values[c]
        x = a.split(';')
        y = []
        w.append([])
        for d in range(len(x)):
            y.append(x[d].split(', '))
        for b in range(len(y)):
            m = y[b][-1]
            w[c].append(str(m))
        # ALTERAÇÃO PARA RETIRADA DOS PAÍSES IGUAIS POR SET  
        for i in range (len(w)):
            w[i] = list(set(w[i]))
    </code></pre>
    <p>
      The whole WOS section to Merge was made so the SCOPUS and WOS database,
      should work together. It proved very buggy as those database constantly
      make modification how they save information and I recommend you to proceed
      with a single database. 
    </p>
    <p>Entering the Bibliometric analysis section you have all the analysis
      that was developed in this code. I will not comment everything because 
      most of the code is the same thing applied for a different problem. I will
      however comment somethings that might give you some headaches in this process.
      Fortunately, I can save you some pain.
    </p>
    <p>This line bellow:    
    </p>
    <pre><code class="language-python">
      for i in range(len(countries_values)):
        lista_paises=countries_values[i].split(', ')
        lista_paises=list(map(lambda x: x.replace("England","United Kingdom"),lista_paises))
    </code></pre>
    <p>
      You will going to have 2 main problems from theses databases in my experience:
      First is the wrong spelling of peoples name, being it a wrong order or letter miss spelling.
      You will going to find a lot of them in random patterns, which makes it difficult to filter.
      My recommendation is to have a good manual scan of your file and to correct most of this things.
      If you are using the same approach as I did, you should have no more than 300 really relevant articles.
      In my opinions it is easier to have this approach than coding filter for those random mistakes.
      In the end it was a bad work of the Journal.
    </p>
    <P>
      Anyway, the second problem is the abbreviation of countries. The most common I found
      was the use of England, United Kingdom, and UK. Be aware for more of this differences, 
      and in the end, it is up to you how you want to group these problems.
    </P>
    <p>
      Also, work with upper or lower case, not both. Not cool.
    </p>
    <pre><code class="language-python">
      kw = [kw.upper() for kw in kw]
    </code></pre>
    <p>
      This section "Análise das citações dos 5 maiores autores por ano" is composed
      by three codes that make a similar analysis, but changing how we consider the authors.
      First case we attribute citation number for every author and then rank them. 
      Second, only the first author receives the citation and then rank. Last,
      only the last author receives the citations and finally rank. This is 
      a matter of choice of how you consider the relevance of the citations. Those
      three are there so I could understand work that would change the analysis.
      (beware, some people might be offended with your findings :p) 
    </p>
    <p>
      Last we have the plot sections: Here you find the plots of the previous analysis.
      You can change the colors changing this value:
    </p>
    <pre><code class="language-python">
      my_cmap = cm.Blues
      ax1.bar(con_l, con_v, color=colors, edgecolor='Darkgrey')
    </code></pre>
    <p>
      section "Plot em barra por pais por quantidade de publicação por citação"
      shows the dual y axis plot of countries by number of documents and total citation number
      (careful, it is wrong the axis saying by year). This analysis was thought 
      to present the volume of production of each country and how relevant is the 
      amount of their publication using as merit the number of citation that those 
      publications have received. This analysis is very interesting because you can 
      have a ratio of citation/number and conclude how relevant are the publication 
      of a specific country. It can be also related to the amount of investment a country
      have in the field. I find it very interesting, sorry if you disagree.  
    </p>
    
    <p>

    </p>
    <p>
      The last part: COreferences anlysis artigo, some library update broke it and I didn't 
      bother fixing it :p. Feel free to ask me anything, glad if you could use and I can help.
